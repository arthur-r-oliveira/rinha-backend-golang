# Rinha de Backend 2025 - Go Edition

This is a backend solution for the Rinha de Backend 2025 challenge, implemented in Go with a focus on **reliability**, **consistency**, and **exploring performance optimization strategies**.

## üöÄ Architecture Overview

The solution employs a microservices-like architecture to handle payment processing efficiently and robustly, especially given the instability of external payment processors.

### Components

*   **Nginx Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming requests across multiple API instances.
*   **API Gateway Instances (5x):** Stateless Go applications responsible for quickly accepting payment requests and queuing them for asynchronous processing.
*   **Worker Service (1x):** A dedicated Go service that processes queued payment requests, interacts with external payment processors, and maintains a consistent payment summary.
*   **Redis:** Used as a persistent and fast data store for:
    *   Storing payment summary data (`totalRequests`, `totalAmount`) to ensure consistency across worker restarts and for the `GET /payments-summary` endpoint.
    *   Tracking processed payment `correlationId`s to ensure idempotency and prevent duplicate processing.
    *   Caching the health status of external payment processors to avoid hitting rate limits on health checks.

### Architecture Flow

```
[Client] ‚Üí [Nginx] ‚Üí [API Instance (Load Balanced)] ‚Üí [Worker (Async)] ‚Üí [External Payment Processors]
                                                               ‚Üì
                                                             [Redis]
```

## üéØ Endpoints

*   **`POST /payments`:** Accepts payment requests. Handled by API instances, which then asynchronously forward to the worker.
*   **`GET /payments-summary`:** Returns an aggregated summary of processed payments. Handled by the worker, which retrieves data from Redis.
*   **`POST /purge-payments`:** Resets all payment data in Redis. Handled by the worker.
*   **`GET /healthz`:** Health check endpoint for all services.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Build and Deploy

Ensure you have `podman-compose` installed.

```bash
# Navigate to your participant directory
cd participantes/arthur-r-oliveira

# Build and start all services
podman-compose up --build -d

# Your API will be available at http://localhost:9999
```

### 2. Test the Implementation

You can use the `k6` tool provided in the `rinha-test` directory of the main challenge repository.

```bash
# Navigate to the rinha-test directory
cd ../../rinha-test

# Run the k6 test (replace $MAX_REQUESTS, $participant, $directory with your values)
k6 run -e MAX_REQUESTS=$MAX_REQUESTS -e PARTICIPANT=$participant -e TOKEN=$(uuidgen) --log-output=file=$directory/k6.logs rinha.js
```

### 3. Basic API Interaction

```bash
# Test payment creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"correlationId": "test-001", "amount": 100.50}'

# Check payment summary
curl http://localhost:9999/payments-summary

# Purge all payments
curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/purge-payments
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Environment variables for services (set in `docker-compose.yml`):

### API Instances
*   `MODE=api` - Specifies the service role as API gateway.
*   `WORKER_HOST=worker` - Hostname of the worker service for internal communication.
*   `WORKER_PORT=8081` - Port of the worker service.
*   `PORT=8080` - Port the API instance listens on.
*   `GOMAXPROCS=1` - Limits the number of OS threads that can execute Go code simultaneously.
*   `REDIS_ADDR=redis:6379` - Address of the Redis service.

### Worker Instance
*   `MODE=worker` - Specifies the service role as worker.
*   `DEFAULT_PROCESSOR_URL=http://payment-processor-default:8080` - URL for the default external payment processor.
*   `FALLBACK_PROCESSOR_URL=http://payment-processor-fallback:8080` - URL for the fallback external payment processor.
*   `PORT=8081` - Port the worker service listens on.
*   `GOMAXPROCS=1` - Limits the number of OS threads that can execute Go code simultaneously.
*   `REDIS_ADDR=redis:6379` - Address of the Redis service.

## üìä Resource Allocation

| Service | CPU | Memory | Purpose |
|---------|-----|--------|---------|
| Nginx | 0.1 | 40MB | Load balancing |
| API Instance (x5) | 0.2 each (1.0 total) | 40MB each (200MB total) | Payment acceptance |
| Worker | 0.3 | 80MB | Payment processing & summary |
| Redis | 0.1 | 30MB | Data persistence & caching |
| **Total** | **1.5** | **350MB** | **Within challenge limits** |

## üí° Design Principles

### 1. Reliability First
- Utilizes standard Go HTTP for robust communication.
- Employs Redis for data persistence and idempotency, ensuring data integrity even with service restarts.

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- API instances are optimized for fast request acceptance.
- The Worker service is dedicated to the heavier task of payment processing and summary aggregation.
- Clear boundaries enhance maintainability and scalability.

### 3. Asynchronous Processing & Graceful Degradation
- Payment requests are queued and processed asynchronously by the worker, allowing the API to respond quickly.
- This design handles external processor instability gracefully, preventing backpressure on the API.

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous processing aims to maximize API throughput.
- Redis provides fast read/write operations for summary data and processed IDs.
- Connection pooling and keepalives are configured for efficient HTTP communication.
- Further optimizations may be explored to reduce `payments_inconsistency`.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### General Issues
1.  Check service logs: `podman-compose logs <service_name>` (e.g., `podman-compose logs worker`)
2.  Verify container status: `podman-compose ps`

### If Payments Summary is Incorrect
1.  Ensure Redis is running and healthy: `podman-compose logs redis`
2.  Check worker logs for Redis connection errors or processing failures.

### If Performance Is Poor
1.  Monitor resource usage: `podman stats`
2.  Check service logs for any errors or bottlenecks.
3.  Verify external payment processor response times.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Local Development

To run the API and Worker locally without `podman-compose`:

```bash
cd api

# Run as API gateway (in one terminal)
MODE=api PORT=8080 WORKER_HOST=localhost WORKER_PORT=8081 REDIS_ADDR=localhost:6379 go run main.go

# Run as worker (in another terminal)
MODE=worker PORT=8081 DEFAULT_PROCESSOR_URL=http://localhost:8001 FALLBACK_PROCESSOR_URL=http://localhost:8002 REDIS_ADDR=localhost:6379 go run main.go
```
